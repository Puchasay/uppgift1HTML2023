            The invention of socks, as we know them today, doesn't have a single
            specific inventor. Socks are believed to have a long and ancient
            history that predates recorded history. They likely developed
            independently in various cultures over time.

            The earliest forms of socks were simple foot coverings made from
            animal skins, furs, or woven fabrics. These early foot coverings
            were designed to provide warmth and protection for the feet, making
            walking more comfortable.

            As civilizations advanced and textile production techniques
            improved, socks evolved into more sophisticated garments. Knitting,
            in particular, played a significant role in the development of
            modern socks. By the Middle Ages, knitted socks had become quite
            common in Europe.
