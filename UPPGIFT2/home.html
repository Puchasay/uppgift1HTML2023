                  the goddess Dewi Danu, the Balinese Hindu goddess of water,
                  lakes, and rivers. It plays a vital role in the island's

                    Borobudur was built in the 9th century during the Sailendra

                    Watching the sunrise from Mount Penanjakan is a must-do
                    experience. To catch the sunrise, you'll need to start your
                    journey in the early morning hours. Many visitors opt for a
                    guided sunrise tour that includes transportation to the
                    viewpoint. Be prepared for chilly temperatures at this time,
                    so dress warmly.

                    more predictable, and you have a better chance of clear
                    views. However, it can get crowded during these months,
                    especially on weekends.

                  <h3>Mummies in Tana Toraja</h3>
                  <p>
                    The mummies of Toraja, Indonesia, are a fascinating cultural
                    phenomenon found in the Toraja region of South Sulawesi.
                    <span class="close open-tablet">
                      These mummies are known locally as "Tau Tau" and "Lembus"
                      and are part of the elaborate and unique burial customs of
                      the Toraja people.</span

                  <p class="close">
                    The mummification practices in Toraja are closely tied to
                    their beliefs about the afterlife. Torajans believe that the
                    deceased person's soul remains with their family until the
                    body is properly buried. The mummification process helps
                    preserve the body for an extended period while the family
                    prepares for the elaborate funeral ceremony.

                  <p class="close">
                    The mummification process in Toraja involves a series of
                    rituals and ceremonies. It typically begins with the
                    deceased being cleaned and dressed in their best clothes.
                    The body is then placed in a special room, often a
                    designated part of the family's house, where it is exposed
                    to smoke from a fire for an extended period. This process
                    slowly dries and preserves the body.
                  </p>
                  <p class="close">
                    In some Toraja communities, wooden effigies called "Tau Tau"
                    are created to represent the deceased. These effigies are
                    typically made to resemble the deceased and are placed in
                    balconies or on cliffs overlooking the village as a sign of
                    respect and remembrance.
                  </p>
                  <p class="close">
                    After the funeral ceremony, the deceased is temporarily
                    buried in a stone tomb or a carved-out chamber in a cliff,
                    often shared with other family members. These temporary
                    resting places are known as "lantang" or "liang." Some
                    Torajans opt for reburial ceremonies, where the remains of
                    the deceased are transferred to a more permanent location.
