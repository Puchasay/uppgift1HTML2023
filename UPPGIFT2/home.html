                Ulun Danu Beratan Temple is situated in the Tabanan Regency of
                Bali, approximately 55 kilometers (34 miles) north of Ubud. It's
                easily accessible by road, making it a popular day trip
                destination.
              </p>

                The temple complex consists of several shrines and pagodas that
                seem to "float" on the calm waters of Lake Bratan, creating a
                postcard-worthy scene. The temple is dedicated to the goddess
                Dewi Danu, the Balinese Hindu goddess of water, lakes, and
                rivers. It plays a vital role in the island's irrigation system
                and is revered by the local Balinese people.

              <p class="close">
                Ulun Danu Beratan Temple is open to visitors daily. To avoid
                crowds and take advantage of the cooler weather, consider
                visiting in the morning. The temple can get crowded during peak
                tourist season. Besides admiring the temple's beauty, you can
                enjoy activities such as exploring the temple gardens, renting
                traditional boats for a paddle on the lake, or picnicking by the
                lakeside.

                While exploring the rice fields, be mindful of the environment.
                Stay on designated paths, avoid trampling on the crops, and
                refrain from littering.

                Tanah Lot is one of Bali's most iconic and culturally
                significant landmarks. It's not just a temple; it's a beautiful
                sea temple perched on a rocky outcrop along Bali's southwestern
                coast.

                Tanah Lot is located in the Tabanan Regency, approximately 20
                kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Kuta and Seminyak. It's
                easily accessible by car or motorcycle.
              </p>
              <p class="close">
                The temple is dedicated to the sea gods and is believed to
                protect Bali from evil spirits. It's an important pilgrimage
                site for the Balinese people. To experience the full beauty of
                Tanah Lot, visit in the late afternoon or early evening. This
                allows you to enjoy the sunset, which is a magical sight as the
                temple is silhouetted against the setting sun.

                You can explore the temple complex, including the main temple
                and smaller shrines. The entire area is beautifully landscaped
                and offers fantastic ocean views. Tanah Lot is accessible during
                low tide by a land bridge, but during high tide, it becomes an
                isolated island. Both times offer unique photo opportunities, so
                check the tide schedule if you want to see the temple from
                different perspectives.

                    Secure your belongings: Monkeys can be mischievous, so keep
                    your bags, sunglasses, and other items secure.

                    Be cautious with food: If you purchase bananas to feed the
                    monkeys, be prepared for them to approach you. Follow the
                    instructions provided by the sanctuary staff.

                  While interacting with the monkeys is one of the highlights,
                  it's essential to exercise caution and follow the sanctuary's
                  guidelines:

              <h3>Gate of Heaven, Lempuyang Temple</h3>
              <p>
                The Gate of Heaven at Lempuyang Temple, also known as Pura
                Lempuyang Luhur, is one of Bali's most iconic and
                Instagram-famous locations.
                <span class="close open-tablet"
                  >The temple complex is perched high on Mount Lempuyang in East
                  Bali and is known for its stunning gate, which frames the
                  towering Mount Agung volcano in the background.</span

                Lempuyang Temple is located in Karangasem Regency, East Bali.
                It's about a 2-3 hour drive from popular tourist areas like
                Ubud, Seminyak, or Kuta. The temple is open daily, but it's best
                to visit early in the morning to avoid crowds and to capture the
                best lighting for photographs.
              </p>
              <p class="close">
                When visiting any Balinese temple, including Lempuyang, it's
                essential to dress respectfully. Both men and women should wear
                clothing that covers their shoulders and knees. Sarongs and
                sashes can often be rented or borrowed at the temple entrance if
                you're not appropriately dressed.
              </p>
              <p class="close">
                The famous Gate of Heaven is the main attraction here. The gate
                is set against the backdrop of Mount Agung, and it appears as
                though you're looking at heaven through the gate. Be prepared
                for a queue to take photos at this spot, as it can get crowded.
