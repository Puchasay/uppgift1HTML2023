                <h3>Borobudur Temple, Yogyakarta</h3>
                <p>
                  Borobudur Temple is one of the most iconic and significant
                  Buddhist temples in the world, and it's a UNESCO World
                  Heritage Site.<span class="close open-tablet"
                    >Borobudur Temple is located in Magelang, Central Java,
                    Indonesia, which is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest
                    of Yogyakarta.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="close">
                  Borobudur was built in the 9th century during the Sailendra
                  dynasty. It is a massive structure that consists of nine
                  stacked platforms topped by a central dome. The temple was
                  abandoned for centuries and was only rediscovered in the 19th
                  century. It has since been restored and is a popular
                  pilgrimage site for Buddhists.
                </p>
                <p class="close">
                  Take your time to explore the temple. It's a labyrinth of
                  galleries with intricate carvings and statues that depict
                  Buddhist teachings and stories. If you want to witness a
                  magical sunrise or sunset at Borobudur, consider arriving
                  early in the morning or in the late afternoon. The views are
                  spectacular, and it's a great time for photography.

                <p class="close">
                  In addition to Borobudur, you can explore other attractions in
                  the area, including Prambanan Temple, Merapi Volcano, and
                  Yogyakarta's cultural and culinary scene.

                <p>
                  Mount Bromo is located in East Java, Indonesia, in the Bromo
                  Tengger Semeru National Park. The nearest major city is
                  Surabaya, which is well-connected by air and road.

                    >Visiting Mount Bromo in East Java, Indonesia, is a
                    remarkable adventure, offering stunning volcanic landscapes
                    and breathtaking sunrises.

                  Watching the sunrise from Mount Penanjakan is a must-do
                  experience. To catch the sunrise, you'll need to start your
                  journey in the early morning hours. Many visitors opt for a
                  guided sunrise tour that includes transportation to the
                  viewpoint. Be prepared for chilly temperatures at this time,
                  so dress warmly.

                  Exploring the area around Mount Bromo often involves hiring a
                  4WD jeep. These tours take you to key viewpoints and
                  attractions like the Sea of Sand and the viewpoint at Kingkong
                  Hill.

                  You can hike to the rim of the Bromo crater to get a closer
                  look at the volcanic activity. This hike is relatively easy
                  but can be quite dusty, so it's advisable to wear a mask.

                <p class="close">
                  The best time to visit Mount Bromo is during the dry season,
                  which typically runs from May to October. The weather is more
                  predictable, and you have a better chance of clear views.
                  However, it can get crowded during these months, especially on
                  weekends.

                <h3>Mummies in Tana Toraja</h3>
                <p>
                  The mummies of Toraja, Indonesia, are a fascinating cultural
                  phenomenon found in the Toraja region of South Sulawesi.
                  <span class="close open-tablet">
                    These mummies are known locally as "Tau Tau" and "Lembus"
                    and are part of the elaborate and unique burial customs of
                    the Toraja people.</span

                <p class="close">
                  The mummification practices in Toraja are closely tied to
                  their beliefs about the afterlife. Torajans believe that the
                  deceased person's soul remains with their family until the
                  body is properly buried. The mummification process helps
                  preserve the body for an extended period while the family
                  prepares for the elaborate funeral ceremony.
                </p>
                <p class="close">
                  The mummification process in Toraja involves a series of
                  rituals and ceremonies. It typically begins with the deceased
                  being cleaned and dressed in their best clothes. The body is
                  then placed in a special room, often a designated part of the
                  family's house, where it is exposed to smoke from a fire for
                  an extended period. This process slowly dries and preserves
                  the body.
                </p>
                <p class="close">
                  In some Toraja communities, wooden effigies called "Tau Tau"
                  are created to represent the deceased. These effigies are
                  typically made to resemble the deceased and are placed in
                  balconies or on cliffs overlooking the village as a sign of
                  respect and remembrance.
                </p>
                <p class="close">
                  After the funeral ceremony, the deceased is temporarily buried
                  in a stone tomb or a carved-out chamber in a cliff, often
                  shared with other family members. These temporary resting
                  places are known as "lantang" or "liang." Some Torajans opt
                  for reburial ceremonies, where the remains of the deceased are
                  transferred to a more permanent location.
